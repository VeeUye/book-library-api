# Book Library API ðŸ“š

A simple book library API that will allow users to create accounts, list books to loan, and request to loan books from other users.

The project is part of the [Manchester Codes](https://manchestercodes.com) Software Engineering Bootcamp.

## Methodologies

I have taken a [Design First](https://swagger.io/blog/api-design/design-first-or-code-first-api-development/) approach to creating this API. All endpoints were designed and documented in [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) before any functional code was written.
